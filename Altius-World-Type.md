This mod provides a new world generation type called "Altius".
"Altius" means higher and deeper.

In this generation type, the nether is connected under overworld and alternate2 is above overworld. The bedrock is replaced by obsidian.

The connection is done by vertical connecting portals.

This feature is still experimental. I am planning to make another skyland dimension to replace alternate2. Give your suggestions in the discord server.
