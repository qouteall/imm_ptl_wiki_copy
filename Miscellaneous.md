### Hand Reach Tweak
Creative players can break and place blocks in a longer range. This aims to make building easier.

It can be disabled in the config.

This mod adds a status effect `immersive_portals:longer_reach`.
You can use `/effect give @p immersive_portals:longer_reach` to increase a player's hand reach.

This mod also adds the potion of longer reach which can be found in the treasure of sponge dungeons in alternate4 dimension.
