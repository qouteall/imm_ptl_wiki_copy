### Helper Commands
#### `/portal tpme <dimension> <x> <y> <z>`

Use this command to teleport yourself across dimensions without loading screen. Can only be invoked by players.

#### `/portal tp <entity> <dimension> <x> <y> <z>`

Teleport entities across dimensions.

#### `/portal goback`

Sometimes you went into a one-way portal and want to come back, but you forgot the coordinate where you come in. Use this command to come back.

### Hand Reach Tweak
(1.16 Forge version does not have this feature)
This feature is disabled in config by default.

Creative players can break and place blocks in a longer range. This aims to make building easier.

When reach entity attributes mod or pehkui mod is present, it will be automatically disabled because of Mixin conflicts.

### OptiFine Compatibility
You need to disable smooth world and render regions if you install OptiFine.


This mod is compatible with most OptiFine shaders. Incompatible with path tracing shaders.

You need to turn off TAA (Temporal Anti Aliasing) and Motion Blur in the shader's option.
