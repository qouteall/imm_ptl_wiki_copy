### OptiFine Compatibility
You need to disable smooth world if you install OptiFine.

This mod is compatible with most OptiFine shaders. Incompatible with path tracing shaders. (The "Fuse View" feature does not work with shaders. The transparent objects in front of the portal can't be normally rendered.)

You need to turn off TAA (Temporal Anti Aliasing) and Motion Blur in the shader's option.

The recommended shader is BSL shader.

### Sodium Compatibility

This mod is not compatible with the official Sodium. However, there is a fork of Sodium that is compatible with this mod: https://github.com/qouteall/sodium-fabric/releases

The "optimized scale box" does not work with sodium.

### Canvas Compatibility

Incompatible.
